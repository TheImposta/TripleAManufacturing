      <h1>About Triple A</h1>

      <h2>How plastic bags are formed</h2>
      <p>Our films are produced using blown-film and cast-film extrusion processes. Thermoplastic resins are melted and forced through a die to form a thin film. For blown-film, air is used to expand the tube of molten polymer which is then cooled and flattened to form a continuous sheet. For cast-film, the molten polymer is extruded onto a chill roll and cooled. The sheet is then slit, sealed, and converted into bags with precise cutting and sealing machinery.</p>

      <h2>Values &amp; Ethics</h2>
      <p>We prioritize consistent quality, transparent sourcing, and responsible manufacturing. Our suppliers are audited for compliance with environmental regulations, and we actively work to reduce scrap and energy usage across production lines. We believe in fair labor practices and maintaining long-term partnerships with our customers.</p>

      <h2>Why buy from us</h2>
      <p>Choosing Triple A means predictable specifications at scale. We offer tight tolerances on thickness, color, and mechanical performance — essential for industrial and wholesale buyers. Our team supports volume forecasts, provides fast lead times, and helps arrange logistics and pickup so you can rely on a continuous supply.</p>
